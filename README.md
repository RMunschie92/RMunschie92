## Hey there 👋

I'm Ryan, a Massachusetts-based web developer focused on frontend development. I like building, tinkering with, and improving projects. I'm interested in the JavaScript ecosytem, accessibility, and performance. I also like books, geography, and gaming. 📘🗺️🎮

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... Some fun side projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Mapbox, getting better with TypeScript.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fresno, CA is the largest US city that doesn't have an Interstate Highway running through it.
